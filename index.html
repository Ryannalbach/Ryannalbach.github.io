        <article>Welcome to my portfolio Index page, here you will find all the info you need to see the projects I'm working on.
            I mainly use MERN stack for JS and some light Python, I can create HTML with fully active CSS for UI and JS for functionality.
            If you would like to see the actual code you can go to my Github profile and look at my repositories. Currently there are some
            projects from MIT which are licensed from them for use and for more information regarding this there are some README files attached to
            the repositories that use those license. Feel free to reach out to me for any more information. Click on the About me tab and find
            a little more out about me.

        Hello my name is Ryan Nalbach, I am currently studying software programming in Java Script.
            I am taking the MIT course for Full Stack MERN and will complete the certificate program in March of 2023.
            I have written a few programs here to demonstrate what I have come to understand so far in this program.
            I wrote this page using CSS and HTML to show an understanding of the grid layout.
            The projects page I used bootstrap to create a carousel that rotates the projects and a layout to demonstrate an understanding of using bootstrap.
            I have made additional pages and script links plus my github and linkedin links to see all my repositories and blogs.
            I have linked a youtube video which I will update as I move along in this course.
